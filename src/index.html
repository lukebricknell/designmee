            Getting a website you and your clients will love has never been so
            easy!
          </h3>
          <p class="text-lg pt-10 font-normal">
            Let Me Explain...<br /><br />

            We understand how busy you as architects are. That your clients
            demand all of your time and more to satisfy their every need and
            want. You don't have time to sit around and go through every minor
            detail of your website. But, you still want a website that
            <span class="font-bold">you absolutely love, right?</span>
            <br /><br />

            Enter us. We don't just make websites for anyone,
            <span class="font-bold">we only make websites for architects.</span>
            Yep, just you, that's it. We focus all of our effort and energy on
            creating the perfect formula for a website that looks as good as
            your designs do, and brings in more customers at the same time...<br /><br />

            So in order to create that website for you in 4 weeks with you
            spending as <span class="font-bold">little time as possible</span>,
            we do things different to most. According to what you tell us about
            your dream website, we compile images of sections that will make
            that dream a reality. In a few hours, we go through each section on
            each page, making minor adjustments and changes according to what
            you want.<br /><br />

            Then, we do an initial design... you approve and we do a final
            design. Then all your work is done! You can sit back and relax as we
            give you constant updates over the next to weeks as we take your
            design, and bring it to life! <br /><br />

            And here's the thing. We're so confident in our ability to make your
            dream website, if you don't like what we give you at the end of four
            weeks, you get your deposit back, and can still keep the website, no
            questions asked.
